# Frontend

## Table of Contents

For the Front-end side, we use React and Redux and uses create-react-app, Webpack, HMR, PostCSS & Express. This project also uses a boilerplate CSS theme for bootstrap known as [Material UI ](https://material-ui.com/).

## What is Arrange.Space for?
Arrange.Space is an web application to make managing car ride arrangements easier and perform some time-consuming tasks automatically. 

I'm impatient! How do I get started?
The fastest way is to click " Person" on the menu, or Import A Spreadsheet 

## Some key features to note:
* Save/Load: from the file menu, saves your arrangement on the server, so you can create more of them and load them later
* Clone: creates a replica of your current arrangement with a new name, for creating "rides back" or copying a template week-by-week
* Groups: clicking " Group" adds a new horizontal grouping of people and cars. Auto-arrange will keep people in the group they are in, so it is good for having multiple departure times or locations
* Undo/Redo: left and right curving arrows near the top of the main user interface
* Sharing: allows people to see your arrangement, even if you change it after you shared it
* Printing: the print view is actually pretty nice
* Editable fields: fields that turn yellow on hover (like the name of a group) can be edited if you click on them, like the name of the arrangement or peoples' names in the import wizard
